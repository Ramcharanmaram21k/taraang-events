- Accent color: Lavender (#E6E6FA) creates a sophisticated contrast, enhancing important elements.
- Font pairing: 'Playfair' (serif) for headlines, lending an elegant, high-end feel; 'PT Sans' (sans-serif) for body text to maintain readability and modern style.
- Center all sections with well-managed spacing to create a balanced, visually appealing design that feels professional and uncluttered.
- Employ a set of modern, minimalist icons, in blue hues. Consistency will reinforce a professional brand image and streamline the user experience.
- Use subtle animations on page transitions, button hovers, and form interactions. For example, use a smooth, quick fade transition.
